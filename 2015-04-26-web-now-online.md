Welcome to Jin's web ! This is a website of Jin Lian (廉晋). I am a PhD research in Complex photonic systems group ( <a href="http://cops.nano-cops.com/">COPS</a>.), Unversity of Twente. You can find more information of me in <a href="/aboutme">About me</a>.  Thanks to the help of my friend Zhaoguo Wang (王兆国), this web is launched finally.

You can find information of my research works and my personal opinions in this web. Some of my blogs will be in Chinese.
