My poster presentation "Dispersion of mode-gap cavities" has won the 3rd prize in the poster session of the  <a href="//http://sciencecamp.eu"> Nanophotonic sciencecamp </a> .  It is a small sciencecamp with extremely great organization.  It is a place that you can really have free discussions with participants.  Also it was held in the Cumberland Lodge, Windsor Great Park, Berkshire  which is a place with beautiful view.
